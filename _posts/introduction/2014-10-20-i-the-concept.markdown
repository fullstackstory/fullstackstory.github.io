So, what is the full stack story? Why am I doing this?

## The Motivation

For years I've talked about two things;

* Writing a book
* Building my own business

But time, money, location, and commitments always got in the way.

But what if there was a to do this at the same time.

What if I can build a product, and at the same time blog about it, in the hope that if anyone cares, I can rework it into a book.

Well, this is that blog, and that product.

## Who Am I?

My name is Matthew Rudy Jacobs.

Usually you'll find me on the internet as `@matthewrudy` ([@matthewrudy on github][github], [@matthewrudy on twitter][twitter])

I started doing Ruby and Rails in 2006, and have worked with a tonne of companies since then. Recently I've worked with;

* [Cronycle][cronycle]
* [Enthuse.me][enthuseme]
* [Refer.me][referme] (the site's gone, but here's a presentation on the tech)

And that's great. It's always good to help clients try and realise their vision.

But what about your own vision?
