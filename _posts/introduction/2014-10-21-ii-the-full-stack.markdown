The title "full stack developer" is totally in fashion. It may sound like vapid posturing, but does it have any meaning?

The term "full stack" has been used with a couple of different meanings over the years. In computing historically it meant someone who understood software as well as hardware.

But the modern full-stack developer is something a little bit different.

My own definition is something like;

> a developer who can work with all levels of a
> product's development, even if their focus is on just one level

And for that purpose here are the layers I think we should split development into.

- Product Development (Ideation, validation, and analytics)
- Layout and Styling (HTML and CSS; or various UI for mobile)
- UI development (Javascript MVC, or a mobile APP)
- Back-end development (APIs, algorithms, tabase, search, ...)
- Deployment (server management, application nfiguration, and netowkring concerns)
- Scaling (optimising your architecture, making compromises for performance and cost)

It's fine the have a focus, but being able to understand all of these different layers
