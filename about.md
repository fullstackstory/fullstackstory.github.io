This blog aims to teach you how to be a full-stack developer.

Over a number of months we will come up with an idea, validate it, and build it out into a fully working product.

The stack we're going to use is;

* Bootstrap for layout and styling
* Ember.js for building a web UI
* Ruby on Rails for building a server-side API
* Postgres for our database
* ElasticSearch for search
* Docker and AWS for deployment
* Go and Riak scaling

So come join us for the ride!
